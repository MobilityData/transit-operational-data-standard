# About TODS

The Transit Operational Data Standard ("TODS") is managed by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org) serving as the [TODS Manager](../governance/governance.md#tods-manager) under the authority of the [TODS Board](../governance/governance.md#tods-board-of-directors) with basic monetary support through 2025 from the [California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP)](https://cal-itp.org).

TODS was [initially developed](spec-development.md) in 2021-2022 by the [TODS Working Group](contributors.md) (now known as *contributors*) using resources from the [California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP)](https://cal-itp.org) in order to:

1. Create a common standard for transit operational data
2. Improve efficiency in dispatching, planning, scheduling, driver shift management, and other back-end transit operations
3. Reduce the burden of generating data for reporting (FTA and other)

As of 2024:

* TODS v1.0 is leveraged by several software vendors and transit agencies,
* TODS v2.0 has been adopted and is ready for implementation,
* [Independent governance and ownership](../governance/governance.md) has been established in order to meet the [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles'](https://interoperablemobility.org) definition of an **Open Standard**.
* TODS is specified as a suggested requirement for Scheduling and CAD/AVL systems in the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles' [Procurement Resource](https://interoperablemobility.org/procurement)
